# Changelog

## v1.8 — 2026-09-24

### Pulpit anchor
- **Snap to the pulpit.** When the speaker steps behind the pulpit, the dead zone can leave the camera resting slightly off-centre. Turn on **Settings → Pulpit**, choose the pulpit preset (e.g. 5) and click **Learn pulpit**. Trackmind recalls the preset and asks the camera where it landed. From then on, whenever the camera comes to rest near that spot, Trackmind recalls the preset and holds the shot. Gestures and leaning won't move it. Tracking resumes as soon as the speaker walks out of the hold zone.
- **Per profile.** Each profile keeps its own anchor (on/off, preset, learned position and tuning), so Sunday AM and Wednesday can use different pulpits, or none. Anchor changes save straight into the active profile. Profiles saved before this version load with the anchor off.
- **Tuning.** *Snap range* sets how close the camera must be, and Settings shows the live distance while tracking. *Settle time* sets how long it must sit still, so walking past the pulpit won't trigger a snap. *Hold zone* sets how far the speaker can move before tracking takes over again.
- **Snap style.** *Recall preset* jumps to the preset (zoom included). *Glide* pans to the learned position at an adjustable speed and keeps the current zoom, for a snap that's barely noticeable on air.
- **On screen.** A **Holding on pulpit** chip shows over the preview while the shot is held, and an amber band outlines the hold zone. You can turn the band off in Settings → Advanced → Pulpit hold zone.
- **Stream Deck.** New **Pulpit Anchor** key: toggle / on / off, showing off, not learned, armed, in range, or holding.
- **Control API.** New `anchor` toggle, and an `anchor` block in `/api/status`.
- Requires a camera that answers the VISCA pan/tilt position inquiry (PTZOptics does).

### Auto-update fixed
- **Updates install again.** Since v1.4, clicking *Install & restart* closed Trackmind and nothing else happened. The installer closed the running app with `taskkill /T`, which also kills that app's child processes. An installer launched through the admin (UAC) prompt counts as a child of the app that started it, so the installer was killing itself before it copied anything. It now waits up to 6 s for Trackmind to close by itself (saving your settings), then force-closes only Trackmind.
- **Survives antivirus locks.** The old `Trackmind.exe` is renamed out of the way instead of deleted, which works even while antivirus is scanning it. If the update still can't be applied, the old version is restored and reopened, with a message saying why.
- **Reopens as you.** After an update, Trackmind now starts as the signed-in user instead of inheriting the installer's admin rights. The same applies to "Launch Trackmind now" at the end of a manual install.
- **The admin prompt comes to the front** instead of sometimes flashing unseen in the taskbar. Trackmind also always exits after starting the installer, so a stuck background task can't hold up the update.
- Updating from v1.4–v1.7 uses the new installer, so the fix applies to this update too.

### Stream Deck
- **Keys fill the whole button.** The glass pane used to sit inset in the key, leaving a visible black border and a smaller picture. It now runs edge to edge, with larger icons and text. Stream Deck + touch-strip segments are full-bleed too, so there are no black gaps along the strip.

### Branding
- **App icon edges fixed.** The large icon sizes had a half-transparent rim that showed as a white fringe on light backgrounds (Explorer, taskbar, installer). The edge is now fully opaque. The Stream Deck marketplace icon and the in-app icon are fixed too.
- The generated logo, icon and installer art moved from the repo root to `logos/`.

## v1.7 — 2026-09-23

### A brand-new Trackmind
- **Rebuilt interface.** The live camera now fills the window, and every control floats over the picture as **liquid glass**: real refraction, specular rims, and tally-colored tints, in the vMix language of green = tracking, amber = lock, red = on air. The window is a native WebView2 window. Run with `--browser` to use it in a web browser instead.
- **Tracking overlay.** A reticle follows the detected subject (green, turning amber when locked), with a dead-zone guide and a "zooming" indicator.
- **Control dock.** Large Tracking, Lock, Auto-Zoom and Home buttons, with live status under each.
- **Live tune.** A floating panel for adjusting vertical aim, smoothing and zoom target, or switching profile, mid-service.
- **Settings sheet.** Camera, Profiles, Tracking, Zoom, Advanced, Stream Deck and About sections. Every change applies and saves immediately; there's no Apply button. You can now also choose the RTSP stream (Main 1080p or Sub 720p).
- **New setup wizard, update prompts, and connection states.** Covers "connecting", "can't reach the camera" (with Reconnect), and "add your camera". Updates show release notes and live download progress.
- **Keyboard shortcuts:** `T` tracking, `L` lock, `Z` auto-zoom, `H` home, `U` live tune, `F` full screen, `,` settings.
- **New logo and app icon.** A tracking frame holding a tally-green subject, whose green dot is also the dot of the "i" in the wordmark. The icon, installer art and README banner are all generated from `branding/`.

### Stream Deck
- **New plugin.** It covers Tracking, Lock Subject, Recall Preset (glows red while on air), Home Preset, Auto-Zoom, Pan/Tilt and Zoom hold keys, Load Profile, Motion Sync, a live Status tile, and a Stream Deck + **Tracking Dial** for live tuning. Keys are rendered as liquid glass, with the same optics as the app. Install by downloading `Trackmind-StreamDeck-v1.7.streamDeckPlugin` from this release and double-clicking it. See `streamdeck/README.md`.

### Control API
- **Local JSON HTTP API** on `127.0.0.1:8742`. It drives tracking, lock, presets, profiles, manual PTZ and live values. The Stream Deck plugin uses it, and so can Companion, vMix scripts and anything else that speaks HTTP. Manual moves have a built-in dead-man switch, so they stop by themselves if the controller goes quiet. External clients can never read the camera login or settings. Full reference in `docs/API.md`.

### Under the hood
- Tkinter and Pillow are gone. The tracking engine is unchanged, and now also serves the interface, the live preview (MJPEG) and state updates (Server-Sent Events) from one local-only server.
- Loading a profile with a different camera now reconnects the stream automatically.

## v1.6 — 2026-06-21

### Fixes
- **Auto-update file-overwrite race condition fixed.** The NSIS installer previously relied on a fixed 2-second sleep after `taskkill`, which was not always enough time for Windows Defender or other AV software to release its lock on the killed process's EXE. NSIS would then silently skip the file copy, relaunch the *old* binary, and the update appeared to do nothing. The installer now confirms the lock is released by repeatedly attempting to delete the old EXE (up to 10 retries × 1 second each = 10 s max) before copying the new one, and explicitly aborts with an error message if the copy still fails.

---

## v1.5 — 2026-06-21

### Fixes
- **Hardened the auto-updater.** The downloaded installer now has its Mark-of-the-Web (the "downloaded from the internet" tag) stripped before launch, so Windows SmartScreen no longer silently blocks the silent/elevated install. The updater also verifies the download finished (catching truncated/empty files) and now reports a clear reason when an update can't start — including when the User Account Control prompt is declined — instead of failing silently.

---

## v1.4 — 2026-06-21

### Fixes
- **Auto-update now actually applies.** The updater launched the silent installer while the old app was still running, so Windows refused to overwrite the locked `.exe` — the install failed quietly and reopening still showed the old version. The installer now force-closes the running app before copying files, then relaunches the updated app when it finishes a silent (auto-update) install. The app also shows an "updating — app will restart" status and exits cleanly so the file unlocks.
- Fixed a Start Menu shortcut that pointed at a folder the installer never created.

## v1.3 — 2026-06-21

### Changes
- **Smoother tracking motion.** The pan/tilt controller now uses continuous proportional speed instead of snapping between discrete slow/fast steps, and ramps acceleration and deceleration so the camera eases into and out of moves rather than jerking. The result is noticeably more cinematic following.
  - New **Motion Smoothing** setting (0–10, default 5) under MOVEMENT tunes how gentle the accel/decel ramps are. 0 restores the old instant behavior; 10 is silkiest (slightly slower to react).
- Added **Motion Sync** setting — when enabled, the PTZOptics camera scales each axis's speed so pan, tilt, and zoom all reach a recalled preset at the same moment, producing smooth, coordinated motion instead of one axis finishing early. Toggle it in the settings panel under the new **Motion Sync** section. The state is saved per profile and applied to the camera on connect.

## v1.2 — 2026-06-03

### Fixes
- Settings panel: pressing Enter or clicking away from any field now immediately applies and saves values — no more needing to click Apply
- Version display: app no longer shows "unknown" when run from certain working directories
- Installer: version is now read automatically from `version.txt` — no more hardcoded version strings to forget to update

### Changes
- GitHub Actions workflow added — releases are now built automatically on Windows when a version tag is pushed
